# QAP1-DATABASE-WINTER2024
This repo is to organize the files for QAP 1 in the Database course (WINTER 2024)

I don't know why I created a README if I wasn't going to add any documentation, I mean it's *one* .zip file it's not exactly worthy of a whole paragraph.
Although I tempted to put something here, so here's a list of my top 5 moths

1. Venezuelan Poodle Moth
2. Rosy Maple Moth
3. Luna Moth
4. Atlas Moth
5. White Ermine Moth
